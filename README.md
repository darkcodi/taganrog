## About the Project

In the digital age, where the quantity of files and data we handle is enormous, finding the exact file you need can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Taganrog is designed to solve this problem by allowing you to tag your files with custom tags and then search through them as easily as you would search the web using Google. Whether it's documents, images, videos, or any other file type, Taganrog brings order to chaos, making your digital life more organized and efficient.

## Features

- ‚ú® **Google-like UI**: Search your files in a neat, Google-like search bar.
- ‚ö° **Blazingly Fast**: tags autocompletion, searching media files, adding/removing tags, everything works within milliseconds(!)
- üíæ **Local Storage**: All your tags and files are stored locally on your machine. There is NO server.
- üñ•Ô∏è **CLI**: Taganrog is also a CLI tool that allows you to manage your tags and files from the command line.
- üì¶ **Portable**: Taganrog is a single binary (that includes both - the CLI and the desktop app), that you can run on any platform without any dependencies.
- üì§ **Exportable**: The entire DB is just a single JSON file that is human-readable and can be easily exported to other systems.
